It was just my luck, then, that the library was closed. On the door hung a small sign, with a handwritten “Closed, be right back!” Maybe I should’ve paid a little more attention when Shiro was explaining the schedules. Figuring I could just lounge around, in case it opened today, I explored the plaza. It was small and old but with that undeniable charm of a place well loved. A bit of a ways off, a *huge* tree stood tall and proud.",
